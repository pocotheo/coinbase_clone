# coinbase_clone

It displays crypto prices like the Coinbase app. I've implemented the trading assets by fetching data via an API and used Bloc state management to change coin price.

What I learned:
REST APIs
Display Graph Data
FutureBuilders
Simple state management without packages
Bloc
Widget architecture
Took a design and turned it into code
